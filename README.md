# Image to Music Converter

This model converts Images into audible tunes in the form of '.wav' files. 

# Ideology

Music is made of notes. Each note has a specific corresponding frequency. To convert an Image into music we map the frequencies of each pixel to a frequency in the musical 
notes. In this project I have worked on HSV color space, where Hue values are corresponded to the frequencies of musical notes.
